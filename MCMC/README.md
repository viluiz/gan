# GAN-based Reduced Order Model for Prediction, Data Assimilation and Uncertainty Quantification

## Files:

- 5.GAN-UncertaintyQuantification-MCMC-fromprior.ipynb: Uncertainty quantification using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (metropolis hastings algorithm -> from prior).
- 5.GAN-UncertaintyQuantification-MCMC-randomwalk.ipynb: Uncertainty quantification using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (metropolis hastings algorithm -> randomwalk).
- 5.GAN-UncertaintyQuantification.ipynb: Uncertainty quantification using the UQ-PredGAN.

## Run

Copy the files to the directories **UQ-PredGAN** and follow the instructions there. The MCMC will take ``a lot of time'' to run.
