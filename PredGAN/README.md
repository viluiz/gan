# Predictive GAN (PredGAN) - Forecasting spatial variation of COVID-19 infection using GAN

- 1.Compression.ipynb -> Compress the 800 variables per time step to 15 variables per time step (the compression used for training and prediction is from PCA. However, there are in this file other types of compression using autoencoders). 

- 2.GAN-training.ipynb -> Train a GAN and save the model 

- 3.GAN-Prediction.ipynb -> Predict with the GAN 

## To execute: 

From inside the notebooks
